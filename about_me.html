	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a recent graduate of Middle Georgia State University with a Bachelor's degree in English and a Minor in Web Development and Instructional technology. I am an avid baker and love to try new recipes and broaden my range of skills. Languages fascinate me and I am currently learning both Spanish and Korean in an attempt to master another way in which to connect with the world outside of my own. 
		Language is the corner stone of civilization and the way in which it is used is important because it has the ability to change the perceptions, hearts, and minds of the people exposed to it. The words that we use matter and when you find the perfect word there is this sense of elation that comes with it, which is why I am on a neverending quest to find the perfect word.  </p>
